    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>An easy lentil soup that is packed with flavor thanks to a dual-use mixture of parsley, garlic, and lemon zest that gets added both before and after cooking.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated zest and 2 tablespoons juice from 1 to 2 lemons</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley leave</li>
        <li>6 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 2 tablespoons)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground blac</li>
        <li>1 large leek, white and pale green parts only, finely chopped (about 1 cup)</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely diced (about 1 cup)</li>
        <li>1 large carrot, peeled finely diced (about 1 cup)</li>
        <li>2 stalks celery, finely diced (about 1 cup)</li>
        <li>1 pound dried brown or Puy lentils</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 quarts homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock or vegetable stock</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine lemon zest, parsley, garlic, and half of olive oil in a medium bowl and stir with a fork until homogenous. Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add leek, onion, carrot, and celery and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add half of parsley-lemon mixture and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add lentils and stir until coated in oil. Add bay leaves and stock. Bring to a boil, reduce to a bare simmer, cover with lid slightly cracked, and cook until lentils are completely tender and falling apart, about 1 hour, adding water as necessary (lentils should be fully covered at all times).</li>
        <li>Using a hand blender, blend soup until as smooth as desired. Alternatively, transfer half of soup to a standing blender, blend until smooth, and fold back into remaining soup. Whisk in lemon juice and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve, drizzling extra lemon-parsley mixture on top of each serving. Soup can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
    </ol>
